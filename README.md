To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Environment Variables Required

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key for AI features
- `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_KEY` - OpenAI organization key
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth client secret
- `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` - OAuth redirect URI

## Testing

The project includes a test suite with some pending tests marked with `@tag :skip`. These tests primarily cover:

- Email synchronization
- Category management
- Unsubscribe functionality
- User interface interactions

To run tests:

```bash
mix test
```

## Known Issues and TODOs

1. Unsubscribe functionality is partially implemented but needs completion
2. Some LiveView tests are pending implementation
3. Email sync process needs optimization for large inboxes
4. Token refresh mechanism needs additional error handling

## Security Notes
